    "\n",
    "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit card / Prepaid card\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bank account services\n",
    "\n",
    "* Theft/Dispute reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mortgages/loans\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

      "on friday xxxx xxxx xxxx my husband and i went into the chase bank on xxxx and xxxx in xxxx to open up a new credit card this was our first experience with this company but this would be my  credit card my husband needed to build his credit because he is from the xxxx and has just become a legal resident in the us about  months ago since he just recently received his us visagreen card state id and ss  he has no credit history therefore he was denied on initial application for the freedom chase credit card  which we expected might happen  then since i have excellent credit and am a us  citizen we were talking about options for a credit card for me to apply for and i could add him on as an authorized user  but the chase emplyee warned us that this would not help his credit which we were ok with  the chase employee was discussing the difference between the different types of credit cards they had to offer he told us that the chase sapphire preferred card had xxxx points on food and travel which is great for us because we fly a lot and enjoy going out to eat he also told us about the xxxx points if we spend  in the first  months which we thought might be doable this card sounded most appealing because of the perks and travel benefits we wanted to hear more about this card and then he gave us completely wrongmisleading information first we asked if we could pay off my other credit card  a citi card which has   apr  with this new card to hit the  mark he said that we could do this and that this would count towards reaching the  mark and then we would be able to get the xxxx points he also failed to mention that there is a huge   fee to transfer credit balances he did nt say anything about any transfer fees he also told us that this chase sapphire preferred card was   apr for the first   months which is completely false information this was the reason that i we signed up for this card  who would nt want   for  months our financial plan was to pay off my citi card    apr  with my new chase sapphire card   supposed to be   apr  to reach the  goal and get the benefits of the xxxx points then we have more time to pay it off because it was   apr for a whole  months he agreed that we could do this and that it would count towards getting the points but again he did nt mention that there was a huge fee to transfer the credit over between cards  and even he we did transfer the money over and pay the   fee it would nt even count towards the points anyway because the  target is with services and purchases only within the first  months  not including credit transfers so this would have been a huge mistake for us because we would have transferred all that money over for no reason and no benefit  we would nt get the xxxx points we would have to pay a  fee to transfer the money over and then we would have to pay a whopping   apr on  vs   as we were promised by this employee if we left the balance where it is on the citi card we would only have to pay   apr compared to   we feel completely mislead and we were straightup lied to this employee gave us false information that led to us making a big decisionmistake which will not benefit us at all he also had me submit the application online so it would save him an extra step rather than doing it in person and going over the details of the card s benefits with us in person i just did it online at his computer in his office while he chatted with my husband i went through the application quickly because i was verbally told all about the card just moments before and he went over all the perks with us  which again was false information  so i trusted what he had told us and did nt read the fine print as thoroughly as i should of  he just went over all the details and so i thought i had a good idea of what the card had to offer now stuck with the card because he warned us that if we cancel the card then it would negatively affect my excellent credit score why should i be penalized for a chase employee s mistake so rather than cancelling the card  it was already in the mail so it was too late  we decided to keep the card so it would nt hurt my credit \n",

      "so then we called chase bank on saturday xxxx xxxx to complain about what happened and try to get a solution to our problem as we feel completely trapped and mislead in this situation we spoke with the same employee and he told us that he had to speak with his manager and then someone would get back to us then a customer service representative called us back later that same day she basically stated that the employee made a mistake he gave us false information and that  disciplinary action would be taken  so she admitted their fault however she did nothing to help us rectify the situation we asked if we could get   apr for  months instead of  months or if we could get the transfer fee waived and she basically told us a flat out no and that we should just cancel the card well i do nt want my credit score hurt for someone else s mistake so we are keeping the card but now we have to try to get the  in the first  months to get the perks and then hopefully pay it off completely before we have to pay the insane interest rate of   my citi card is   and my credit is excellent so i can not believe how high that apr is for this new chase card but again we feel stuck and now feel as if we have no choice but to use the card and try to reap the benefits i feel that even getting   apr for  months would be a decent compromise so we can take advantage of the benefits of this card as we hoped to do initially when we were presented with this false information as well as getting the credit transfer fee waived one time i feel that this is only fair considering what we have been through and i can not believe that chase are not willing to help or work with us\n",

      "so right after i was approved for the xxxx i opened the box to see my new card six hours later all my chase cards in my xxxx were deactivated i then called the number on the back of card to find that all my accounts were closed so you approve me for a card and then you close it out after i activate the card i called and spoke with a represintive and she said that the accounts were closed because i ve opend to many accounts within the last  months but i would nt have applied unless i knew i could pay down the balacnce and would have never applied for the xxxx if it was going to result in a closure rep was nt having it now that i look back she was kinda rude anyways was told that i can call back within  months to see if they would reinstate the accounts so xxxx are out of commition untill further notice what do i do to make sure that they are nt permantley closed my scores are xxxx across the board and i am under   utilization on all my cards no other lender i use xxxx xxxx or xxxx have done this they have actually increased my credit limits and lowered my interest rates with out me requesting i ve heard some stores of customers going through similar situations and getting their accounts reopened so i still have the cards they close with little hope chase will maybe reopen them while i continue to make payments to prevent a permanent closure and others are just telling me all the more reason to hate america s biggest bank\n",

      "during xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx i had been rebuilding my credit which was ruined due to a long and costly divorce i recently applied for several credit card at chase card services i was approved for the chase british airways card with a  credit line on xxxxxxxx i was also approved for the chase aarp card on xxxxxxxx for a  credit line on xxxxxxxx both of my cards were closed by chase without any notification when i tried to make a charge on the british airways card on xxxxxxxx it was declined i immediately called customer service and was told my accounts were closed and i would be receiving a letter the rep would not tell me the reason why i went into a chase branch in xxxx and spoke with a banker who called card services and was told the accounts were closed but not given a reason i filed a compliant with the executive office while in the branch on tuesday xxxxxxxx i spoke with xxxx xxxx at the executive office who told me the accounts were closed due to too many recent inquires and new accounts open this was an absolute surprise to me because chase has substantial previous knowledge that i was rebuilding my credit yet they approved me for two cards then they made a blatant lie for the reason to close my account on xxxx xxxx  i applied for a chase aarp card and was declined  letter enclosed  due to too many recent inquiries and new accounts opened chase pulled my xxxx credit report then on xxxx xxxx  i applied for a chase freedom card and was declined  letter enclosed  for having too many inquiries and new accounts again chase pulled my xxxx credit report on xxxxxxxx i applied for the chase british airways card and was approved for a  credit line  letter enclosed  again xxxx credit report was pulled on xxxxxxxx i applied for a chase sapphire visa and was declined  letter enclosed  chase cited too many new accounts and inquiries again xxxx credit report was pulled on xxxxxxxx i asked chase to reconsider my sapphire application they declined also citing my xxxx credit report and the same reasons on xxxxxxxx i applied and was approved for the chase aarp card with a credit line of  again my xxxx report was pulled then on xxxxxxxx xxxx accounts were closed  letter enclosed  saying i had to many new accounts and inquiries when this same information was known when i was approved for both cards and the aarp only four days earlier i had not even received the aarp card when it was closed so chase is not being honest when they say my accounts were closed because of inquiries and new accounts because only four days earlier they approved the chase aarp card further chase had pulled my credit report on seven different inquiries and had full and complete knowledge i was  rebuilding my credit yet approved me twice on the british airways card you could earn xxxx points toward airline tickets if you spend  in three months and another xxxx points if you spend a total of  and another xxxx points if you spend a total of  in one year plus for every year you spend  you can earn a free companion ticket to xxxx in the first and only month i had the british airways card i charged over  easily earning the first xxxx points i also made payments totaling  in one month with an income over  chase was well aware that i could easily hit these spending target and did not want me to reach these goals further these cards encourage you to try and reach these reward targets the aarp card also offered  cash reward if you spend  in the first three months chase had no reason to close my accounts because they knew from my credit reports that i had numerous new accounts and inquiries yet issued two credit cards further i paid the one card over  well over the minimum amount due in one month so i was not delinquent chase was unprofessional and unethical in closing these accounts with no notice even though that had full knowledge so with my account now closed i can not get earn points also it is strange that chase always declined me for their own branded credit cards but approved me for partner cobranded cards and then closed them when the reward targets were achievable i am a customer of chase with a checking account saving account prepaid chase liquid account and even have part of my payroll automatically deposited with chase i have written letters to xxxx xxxx chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase and xxxx xxxx ceo for chase card services for their assistance in getting these accounts reopened chase has acted in a most unprofessional manner and under false pretenses in closing my accounts after approving one only four days earlier knowing i was rebuilding i have asked the executive office to reconsider and help me to reopen these accounts without any success also i was told chase will report these accounts as closed by credit grantor which will hurt my credit score and chances of getting credit i did nt even have the aarp card before it was closed now it will appear on my credit report as a negative account and the british airways will also appears closed by credit grantor even though i paid over  in one month i did nothing wrong to get open these cards i utilized them and paid them well above the minimum chase should have given me a chance to establish a payment history before resorting this adverse action plus chase lied about the  reason they closed my accounts i was told the criteria for approving an account was different from the criteria for closing an account how could chase approve an credit card on xxxxxxxx from my xxxx  credit report and then closed it on xxxxxxxx using the same xxxx report that had the exact same information chase had full knowledge when they approve the british airways card and the aarp card chase has also discriminated against me by always declining my applications for the chase branded cards but only approved me for the partner cobranded credit cards\n",

obvious scam but in the events industry working for clientsevents of all types plus her technical computer shortcomings i regularly have to help her out with  none of this seemed like a red flag

up random things last minute  gift cards being one of them i tried to just buy the gift cards online but ran into all these fraud issues for buying gift cards myself  again i know that shouldve been a red flag now but at the time it actually further reiterated to me why my boss asked me to go get some real cards because she is so computer illiterate i thought  if im having problems buying cards online too no wonder why she gave up and asked me to run to the store while trapped in a conference call  i texted my boss if she needed any other cards or anything else while i was at the store but the message wasnt immediately deliveredseen  again further reiterating to me she was stuck in a meeting unable to get to her phone because i know she puts her phone on do not disturb when in meetingsdoes nt look at it i purchased the gift cards i had managed to purchase three gifts cards totalling  each online at xxxxxxxx before that site and all other gift card malls blocked any further transactions  again this just reiterated to me why she needed me to go in person to get cards because she mustve also had this much trouble herself buying them and couldnt escape the meeting she was in to get the cards needed in time  i went to xxxx  local grocery store in xxxx arizona  two times to purchase xxxx xxxx gift cards  first transaction   second transaction    the total amount for all purchases online and in store was  when i got home she  aka the scammer posing as my boss  instructed me to just send the redemption and activation codes i did like i have in the past for various purchases for my boss i was preparing my reimbursement invoice when i received another email asking for more gift cards because something come up again she was writing like we she usually does with me i was feeling kinda weird about it and brought it up to my husband he told me to try calling or texting my boss again it didnt go through at first i messaged again saying i needed to talk to her asap and then tried to called her she called back four minutes later and had no idea what i was talking about i immediately tried all the card redemption numbers and they said they were all claimed i

marked the message as  important   i am not a millionaire i am just trying to get by in this crazy year but now im out  for a scam id like to see how many other people would catch if they were in my positioni received an xxxxxxxxemail that said it was from my boss  had her name and wasnt reported as spam  with her signature the email sounded like my boss my  boss  asked if i was busy and if i could help her out by running to pick up some gift cards she needed for a client but couldnt get herself because she was trapped in a conference call and if i could shed reimburse me asap i understand this sounds like an obvious scam but in the events industry working for clientsevents of all types plus her technical computer shortcomings i regularly have to help her out with  none of this seemed like a red flag espeically since the email seemed to be sent by her and she wrote in a way she typically does asking me to do something she has asked me to do before my boss often asks me to run and pick up random things last minute  gift cards being one of them i tried to just buy the gift cards online but ran into all these fraud issues for buying gift cards  again i know that shouldve been a red flag but at the time it actually further reiterated to me why my boss asked me to go get some real cards because she is so computer illiterate i thought  if im having problems buying cards online too no wonder why she gave up and asked me to run to the store while trapped in a conference call  i texted my boss if she needed any other cards or anything else while i was at the store but the message wasnt immediately deliveredseen  again further reiterating to me she was stuck in a meeting unable to get to her phone i purchased the gift cards i had managed to purchase three gifts cards totalling  each online at xxxxxxxx before that site and all other gift card malls blocked any further transactions  again this just reiterated to me why she needed me to go in person to get cards because she mustve also had this much trouble herself buying them and couldnt escape the meeting she was in to get the cards needed in time  i went to xxxx  local grocery store in xxxx arizona  two times to purchase xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxx  first transaction   second transaction   xxxx the total amount for all purchases online and in store was  when i got home she  aka the scammer posing as my boss  instructed me to just send the redemption and activation codes i did like i have in the past for various purchases for my boss i was preparing my reimbursement invoice when i received another email asking for more gift cards because something come up again she was writing like we she usually does with me i was feeling kinda weird about it and brought it up to my husband he told me to try calling or texting my boss again it didnt go through at first i messaged again saying i needed to talk to her asap and then tried to called her she called back four minutes later and had no idea what i was talking about i immediately tried all the card redemption numbers and they said they were all claimed i immediately contacted my bank  chase  and xxxxxxxxxxxx   i filed a complaint with ftc i

      "unfortunately my happiness and excitement did not last long because i received another phone call monday afternoon from a woman who identified herself as the fraud investigator assigned to my case i can not remember the womans name but i was given her contact information as xxxx extension xxxx this fraud investigator stated she had concluded  her  investigation and decided that the charges reported were not fraud because my ex was  given access to these cards by me because she lived with me  i immediately stopped her and informed her that i had never given her access and she was mistaken someone obviously had made a mistake on the file the investigator stated that she had not made any mistake and that since the person who committed this fraud lived with me she naturally would have had access to my cards by simply going into my dresser or wallet to take these cards and use them even if i didnt give her permission to do so \n",
      "\n",
      "after hearing this comment i was livid with such as careless point of view that she was suggesting i was to blame for this fraud because simply living with someone was enough grounds to determine they  might  take your card some day and use it without your permission and put it back as a result by them living in your residence it is now your fault even though we have never been married and she was never an authorized user on my card this made no sense to me and i immediately told this supervisor i could not believe someone could steal a credit card from me use it and put it back and it was acceptable simply because she lived at my residence this would mean that absolutely anyone who had a roommate or child or even just a friend living with them would be exposed to this same credit card fraud because she is blaming the victim for someone living in their home the investigator stated that  well sir we are a financial institution and we simply can not refund these charges because you allowed her to use them since she was living there and as a result she knew how to gain access to the cards  i wish that this phone conversation had not been as devastating as it was but then the investigator continued to tell me she had more bad news the investigator stated that chase had  mistakenly double refunded the charges and as a result we are putting approximately  back on your card because we accidentally made a  mistake  i tried to stop her and ask for more of an explanation of how could this possibly happen how can a financial institution make such a stupid error and tell me they made a  mistake and were telling me that they were now going to add this back onto my card along with all charges she whimsically decided to deny refunds on for a balance of  on a single credit card that only had a maximum credit limit of  this means that if she would follow through with this decision the banks unforgivable mistake would end up making me look like i had a balance that exceeded my credit limit by over  and absolutely destroy my credit rating in the process they would also be charging me the feels that would make withdrawing the money from the atm s as my refund appear to be cash advances at the rate of   on top of   for the fraudulent charges the minimum payments on this card would absolutely bankrupt me and i was the victim of fraud how could this even be acceptable for someone to be the victim of fraud try to resolve the situation on behalf of the credit card companies by making payments and even trying to get thief to pay the funds back in full and then victimize me a second time by taking all the money back hitting me with their  mistake because someone miscalculated and told me that money was mine to use and then now want it back after it has been spent all while i was promised in the beginning that these fraudulent charges would not be my responsibility from the very day i called if i had known this is how terrible the service was and that the credit card companies could not even figure out how to do their own refunds properly without making any mistakes i would never have opened the card to begin with that way i could never have been victimized through the fraud by chase and their guarantee that i had  zero fraud liability  and was protected that is apparently not true because their investigator simply wanted to find a way to blame me for the charges when they couldt find any other way to deny the claim she would make a ridiculous conclusion that simply living with her negated the fraud and was now my responsibility i did not receive these  same statements from xxxx xxxx xxxx nor xxxx xxxx and xxxx lost far more money than chase in the theft in the amount of nearly  alone yet they have refunded the amounts and asked for affidavits of fraud and any assistance of criminal prosecution of my ex girl friend chase did not even so much as offer me an affidavit to sign for fraud and i have offered on numerous occasions to assist them with any criminal charges should they choose to pursue that avenue i once again informed this same fraud investigator that i would be willing to assist with a criminal investigation to assist them as i was doing the same with xxxx card yet she said to her this was entirely civil and they were not going to refund any money she did not care that her decision was unfounded and had no compassion that her decision is going to wreck my financially and destroy my credit so i immediately told the investigator that i wanted this decision appealed to a supervisor for review as i did not feel her determination was one based on any factual reasoning that was a legitimate law or policy she stated that she could try to get a supervisor on the phone but they were busy or she could resubmit this case to a department but that they would need to do another full investigation i told her that would be find as i knew that these charges were fraudulent and i would not allow her to call these unauthorized charges my responsibility based on her statement my exgirlfriend could make those charges simply because she lived in the same house hold why would anyone ever need an authorized user card then apparently she believed you can just take someones card behind their back and use it and it would be perfectly acceptable so i stated i wanted the review done on my decision and the account to be looked at by another person above her with more authority i told her i wanted this account left alone since adding this xxxx back onto my card was an unfair burden on both me and my credit and that would cause me even further damage the investigator simply stated that  the file will be submitted for review and further investigation  and my full belief is she understood i was appealing her decision and asking for someone else to review this account and stay her reversal onto my card i am now looking at my account today and realizing that this investigator did the exact opposite and i now have all charges put back onto my card with a balance of  with no available credit and over the limit by  my credit rating which was severely harmed from the fraudulent credit card charges will not be even further destroyed just as i began to recover there is no possible way i can in good conscience make payments on charges i know are both fraud due to theft and also mistakes made by the same company that promised to protect me should this happen instead both parties are further harming me financially by making me liable for them and i am the victim it is unimaginable to me to think any reputable company would be so callous reckless and irresponsible to the victim of a crime and then further harm them by claiming they  accidentally  made a mistake of  that is not my fault that they made that mistake as they were the ones who informed me i could spend this money as it was mine i would never charge  on a credit card in this manner as i am far more financially responsible that this and i feel as they have now baited me into a trap and are trying to wash their hands of their own responsibility for both the fraud and their  error  of double refunding me charges i am not able to pay this money back and i do not have the the ability to make the massive monthly payments their error will incur on me this is simply not something i can ever forget and i will likely be forced to switch my credit card accounts to another company in the future as i feel there was never any intention to help me with being defrauded by this investigator i will make sure to tell everyone i know to cancel any credit card bank account investment product and any other item they may have with chase or any chase bank due to how i was treated and how they have proven their word of  zero fraud liability  really doesnt actually apply and superficial reasons will be made up that do not even exist in their card polices \n",

      "the only benefit i can see from this otherwise unpleasant set of experiences is that i now understand that these declines were the result of chase policy aimed at onboarding only those new account holders who are likely to be profitable undoubtedly chase s analytics have found that on average people who open more than  new credit cards within  months are not likely to generate sufficient spend to offset the cost of the signon bonus and so chase automatically declines all such applicants \n",
      "\n",
      "while a company may have the right to institute any nondiscriminatory rules to maximize their revenue and protect their profit i think chase s sales practices need to be changed chase credit card application solicitations advertising new account bonuses should clearly disclose to the prospective applicant that heshe will be declined automatically if heshe has opened  new credit card accounts within the last  years these disclosures should be in bold print large font so other customers do not have the same experience i have  taking time out of my day to apply for a chase card feeling the sting of decline and the subsequent hit to my credit score \n",

      "\n",
      "when this is not the case as with the chase  rule i think the burden is on the card company advertising their cards to state autodecline rules such as these right up front and in plain view to the prospective applicant otherwise their solicitations are unfairly misleading applicants who are affected by but not otherwise aware of these automatic rules to applying for a product when it is already preordained that they will be automatically declined and then suffer a hit to their credit score\n",

      "on xxxxxxxx i xxxx bought five round trip tickets to the xxxx but immediately saw an error in the return dates which i hadnt caused this was due to what appears to have been a glitch in the travel website  xxxx  although it would be hard to prove that  though we saw the problem reoccur again later also trying to rectify the mistake caused by a computer glitch by cancelling or changing the dates with this company resulted potentially in very expensive cancelation and change date fees that were effective immediately even within minutes of trying to do so \n",
      "so immediately after the transaction i decided to firstly contact chase bank to tell them what had just happened the credit card department representative i spoke with told me several things which i was later told were untrue and caused me to be considered liable for the charges when i may have otherwise been able to resolve the issue in other ways she asked me if someone else had used my card i said  no  and briefly explained what had happened she then said she would cancel my card and reissue another card with a new account number she also said that my card could not be charged this i later have been informed is not how credit card charges work but at the time it seemed clear to me that i needed to take no further actions i actually asked that exact question if i needed to take further actions and she said  no  that there was nothing more i needed to do from my end she also did not explain the process at all and there was no mention of the fact  i later found out  that there are different catagories depending on the credit card issue such as a dispute versus a fraud issue i was not informed of anything she catagorized the issue decided the steps to take and i followed her professional leading \n",
      "perhaps if i had contacted the travel site first instead of chase they may have made an exception to their rule since i had not intended to purchase tickets with those dates and only did because of what appears to have been a glitch on their website but i had called chase firstly and followed the representatives advice and was told that no other action was necessary \n",
      "i expect to be able to trust that the bank representative is informed on credit card and bank policy so if they give me certain directions or assurances i expect them to be correct two entire months passed with no communication from the bank and suddenly the charges which i had been assured were dealt with reappeared on my credit card two full months after being removed i had absolutely not been informed that in actual fact this matter was not resolved in the first place and without my knowledge an investigation was underway by chase credit card services xxxxxxxx  was the first i heard about an investigation and a recharge so over  weeks later by this stage myself and the family had returned from our xxxx trip on correct tickets \n",
      "if i had realized that the bank representative wasnt correct i would have called the travel website to request that they make an exception to their rule and done everything in my power to resolve the problem myself i was however reassured by the chase representative i spoke to that my card could no longer be charged and that there was nothing more to do at my end \n",
      "furthermore i was not informed that the issue wasnt resolved until after the outbound flight occurred which i believed did not exist with non payment due to card cancellation back on xxxxxxxx minutes after the error had occurred i had no idea these tickets were still in existence  so i didnt even have a chance to contact the airline and cancel with them in time \n",
      "after speaking now to xxxx xxxx and explaining the situation representative i spoke to said she believed that chase had caused this issue with misinformation she stated that a bank representative calling a charge fraudulent which i stated is not fraudulent was pretty careless chase not only catagorized our dispute wrongly but also did not inform me that there was an upcoming dispute and that infact the issue wasnt resolved yet and they also failed to communicate for an entire two months so i had absolutely no idea anything was unresolved and mistakes had been made until xxxxxxxx\n",

prequalified for this card offer  and the product it was referring to was the chase freedom unlimited credit card upon clicking the link to see the offer details the terms and conditions stated that this is a preapproved offer based on my credit profile and that final approval is dependent on my credit report meeting chase s criteria for approval i am relatively new to applying for my own credit card but my research indicated that the chase freedom unlimited card was a good product with favorable reviews so i decided to accept the offer upon entering the requested information i submitted my acceptance of the preapproved offer and was instantly greeted with a  you have been approved  notification my credit monitoring service alerted me that chase pulled my xxxx  credit report the same day on xxxxxxxx after i had received my chase debit card and conducted a few banking transactions i had logged into my chase online banking account and once again found another offer under the  just for you  section this advertising was the same as before citing  you are prequalified for this card offer  but showed a different product it was for the chase sapphire preferred credit card upon clicking into the details for the offer once again it confirmed that i was preapproved for the account and that approval would be dependent on my credit report meeting chase s criteria for approval my research into the chase credit cards confirmed that this was an excellent product to have and the added bonus of the xxxx points after meeting spending requirements convinced me to accept the offer for this product as well upon providing the information requested and submitted the application button i was excited to see that i was once again approved for the account i received another notification from xxxx that chase had pulled my credit report on xxxxxxxx the same day i was excited that i was a now a cardholder of two excellent credit cards available on the market i had not even received my first credit card yet when i was notified by xxxx that chase had pulled my credit report again on xxxxxxxx for the  time without me applying for another credit product upon checking my chase online banking i saw that my newly approved credit card accounts with chase had been marked with a closed status i called chase and spoke to a rep who informed me of the reasons for closure citing that i did not have enough credit history and that was the reason for closure i requested for a review for reinstatement because it did not make sense for chase to advertise to me and to give me a preapproved offer and then close my accounts after the fact that they had approved me i told the chase rep that i had just started banking there and that i applied for those two credit cards because chase offered it to me the rep submitted my accounts for a review for reinstatement and told me i had to wait  days for the outcome of the review a few days later i received a phone call from a chase rep from the lending department and the rep informed me that a review of my account for reinstatement has been denied due to the fact that i had limited credit history i explained to the rep that it is true that i am new to applying for credit but i applied because chase was the one that offered me the products and advertised it to me as a preapproved offer i explained that chase already knew about my credit profile and had my credit report when it decided to approve my application and that it wasnt right for chase to approve me and then subsequently close my accounts citing reasons that they already knew when they approved my application the rep explained to me that the chase lending department that closed my account is not the same department that handles account approvals and said that it is unfortunate that the department that handles approvals is separate from the department that decided to close my account and that there is nothing they can do and my review for reinstatement was denied after contemplating this issue for awhile and doing some research online i was able to find several sources indicating that chase bank has been shutting down the credit card accounts of several credit card super users who are defined as savy credit card users who apply for several credit cards to take advantage of signup offers and bonuses and then close the cards before applying again i am not a credit card churner and i am not trying to signup for credit cards to game the system to reap rewards and then close the accounts to try to obtain more bonuses i am just beginning on my credit journey and i think chase has mistakenly flagged my accounts and shut my accounts down for reasons that ridiculous and unreasonable chase offered the credit card products to me to begin with and i was not specifically looking to obtain the products offered prior to chase s product advertising my applications were approved by chase and chase was aware of my credit status when it approved me to close my account citing reasons that chase already knew about is unreasonable and unfair not only is the closure of my new accounts unreasonable it is more detrimental to my credit health than if chase were to just deny my application in the first place the unreasonable closure of my newly approved chase credit cards will forfeit my opportunity to receive the signup bonus offers that were advertised and will prevent me from receiving the bonus offers for  years not only that but now i will have  newly closed credit accounts that i never had the opportunity to even use that those closed accounts are being remarked as closed by credit grantor which can negatively impact my future relationships with other lenders i want chase to reinstatement my accounts because i deserve a chance to build my credit history after being targeted by chase s enticing advertising and being given a preapproved offer i assert that i havent done anything wrong and i havent demonstrated being any more high risk than i was when chase approved my new credit card accounts chase has demonstrated extremely predatory lending practices that have been detrimental to my credit health and im sure this is all a

but also promises up to  of automatic reimbursement for travel each year on xxxxxxxx i spoke to a customer service representative  i believe to activate the card  and during that call asked to clarify how this program worked i was told that any travelrelated purchases that i made before xxxxxxxx  the date of my xxxxxxxx statement  would count towards the  reimbursement for xxxxxxxx and any purchases made after that point would count against my  reimbursement for xxxxxxxx  i have since been told that chase has changed this policy in recent months and a year is now defined as  months from the opening of the card rather than by calendar year  pi received  of  travel credit  on my xxxxxxxx statement and an additional  on my statement for xxxxxxxx for a total of  dollars for the  year however i made two purchases of airline tickets on xxxxxxxx of  and  i chose this date specifically to conform with the information i had been given by the bank  i am a xxxxxxxx and these purchases were for my flights home for winter break several weeks later but i made sure to purchase them within the xxxxxxxx travel credit cycle  these purchases did not appear on my xxxxxxxx statement however and when i noticed this and contacted the bank the bank informed me that they were credited against my  travel credit for xxxxxxxx leaving  of my xxxxxxxx credit unused and my entire xxxxxxxx credit depleted after raising this issue with customer service i received a letter dated xxxxxxxx that explained that  annually  means the year beginning with your account open date through the first xxxxxxxx statement date of that same year and each  billing cycles starting after your xxxx  statement date through the following xxxxxxxx statement date  but that  all applicable travel credits on charges that have posted to your account after the statement closing date of xxxxxxxx have been added to the   travel credit  for xxxxxxxx  a contradictory response that seemed to turn on the distinction between the date a purchase was made and the opaque process by which that purchase is  posted  to my account after i finished my finals last month i contacted the bank to follow up and explained to them that a customer service representative had informed me that any purchases made before xxxxxxxx would count against my travel credit for xxxxxxxx while any purchases made afterwards would count against xxxxxxxx pthis saturday  xxxxxxxx  i was contacted by customer service who informed me  in a recorded call  that they had located the call i described  which took place on xxxxxxxx as per their records  and that i was told that any purchases made before xxxxxxxx would count towards my xxxxxxxxtravel credit while any purchases made after that date would count towards my xxxxxxxx credit they explained however that because the airline ticket purchases had  posted  after xxxxxxxx and thus did not appear on my xxxxxxxx statement that the bank had determined that those purchases could not be counted towards my xxxxxxxx travel credit despite their having told me different information on a customer service call and having since told me that if they had told me different information on a customer service call they would correct their error and apply those charges towards my xxxxxxxx travel credit a difference worth  to me pi repeatedly asked the representative to whom i was speaking to confirm with a yes or a no that the bank s determination was that i had been told that any purchases made before xxxxxxxx would be counted towards my xxxxxxxx travel credit that i made two purchases on xxxxxxxx but that the because those purchases had not  posted  before xxxxxxxx the bank would instead by applying them to my xxxxxxxx travel credit the representative refused to answer the question repeatedly responding by reiterating the fact that the charges did not post by xxxxxxxx  without addressing the substance of my question  or claiming that he could nt hear me clearly pi then asked the question differently asking the representative to say a simple  no  if he was legally able to if there was anything incorrect about the assertion that the bank had informed me that any purchases made before xxxxxxxx would count towards my xxxxxxxx travel credit that i made  purchases on xxxxxxxx and that the bank had determined that because those purchases did not  post  until after xxxxxxxx the bank was refusing to apply them to my xxxxxxxx travel credit he refused to say  no  to this assertion despite being asked multiple times to please do so if he was factually or legally able to pat this point i asked to be transferred to someone else and was informed that that was not possible  i was told instead that the only way to further escalate my complaint was to notify the bank in writing i again asked the representative to either confirm or dispute my understanding of what he was telling me  namely that   the bank had informed me in a recorded call that any purchases made before xxxxxxxx would count towards my xxxxxxxx travel credit   that i had made  purchases on xxxxxxxx and   that the bank had determined that despite what they had told me those purchases would be counted toward my xxxxxxxxtravel credit because they did not  post  by xxxxxxxx he again refused to either confirm that these three facts were correct or to dispute any of them and instead became irritated telling me that he was tired of repeating himself and that he respected my time but that if i had no further questions he was going to end the call in closing i thanked him for confirming  by repeatedly refusing to substantively dispute  on a recorded call that the central facts of the situation supported my contention that these charges were improperly credited toward my xxxxxxxx travel credit\n",
